# My First-Year Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I worked on during my first semester with a group. Here's a brief overview of each project:

## Sudoku Solver (Python)

The Sudoku Solver project is a Python program that can solve Sudoku puzzles. It was created as part of my first-year programming coursework. The program has some unsolved Sudoku puzzles and uses backtracking to find a solution (an easy modification could make it have input, we choose it this way so we won't lose time while interpreting our code when presenting the project).

### Project Details

- Project Files: [sudoku_solver.py](https://github.com/XilagX/projects/blob/main/Soduko/Source%20code.py)
- Usage: Run the script and follow instructions.

### Project Demo
To see the Sudoku Solver in action, you can run the following command:
```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
```
## Connect 4 Game (C)

The Connect 4 Game is a project implemented in C. This project was also part of my first-year programming part-work. The game allows two players to take turns placing their colored tokens(1 and 2 in my code) on a grid, with the goal of connecting four tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

### Project Details

- **Project Files:** [connect_4.c](https://github.com/XilagX/projects/tree/main/Game%20Connect%204)
- **Usage:** Compile and run the C program, and follow on-screen instructions to play the game.

### Project Demo
To experience the Connect 4 Game, you can compile and run the program using the following commands:
```bash
gcc connect_4.c -o connect_4
./connect_4
```
**Note:** The Connect 4 Game code is structured into a main function and a header file to enhance modularity and organization.

Please be aware that this project focuses on a text-based interface, and there is no graphical user interface (GUI) in the implementation.
